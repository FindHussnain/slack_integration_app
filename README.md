## Setup & Installation

To get this app up and running locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 3.2+)
- Rails (version 7.0+)
- PostgreSQL (or any database supported by Rails)
- Node.js and Yarn (for Tailwind CSS)
- Slack webhook for notifications
- Letter Opener for email testing

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/slack_integration_app.git
    cd slack_integration_app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - For Ruby dependencies:
      ```bash
      bundle install
      ```
    - For JavaScript and Tailwind:
      ```bash
      yarn install
      ```

3. **Set up the database**:
    ```bash
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
    ```

4. **Configure Slack Integration**:
    - **Create a Slack App**:
      1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new Slack App.
      2. Enable **Incoming Webhooks** for your Slack App and configure it to send messages to the desired Slack channel (e.g., `#general`).
      3. Copy the **Webhook URL** generated by Slack.
      
    - **Configure the Webhook URL in Rails**:
      Run the following command to edit the credentials in your Rails application:
      
      ```bash
      EDITOR="nano" bin/rails credentials:edit
      ```
      
      Add your Slack webhook URL under the `slack` section:
      
      ```yaml
      slack:
        webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/XXXX/XXXX"
      ```
      
      Save and exit.

5. **Configure Letter Opener for Email Testing**:
    In the development environment, Letter Opener is used to catch outgoing emails (e.g., password resets). To configure it, add this configuration to `config/environments/development.rb`:
    
    ```ruby
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
    ```

6. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    rails server
    ```

7. **Access the application**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
